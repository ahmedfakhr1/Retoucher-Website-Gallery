# Retoucher Website Gallery
 • This is a personal project for myself since i do freelance retouching as a hobby, i wanted to have my own website to show my works in the way i like. 
 • I uploaded images on a free image Hosting service and used private links to refer to them. • the website has two main pages,The Image gallery which is a horizontal slider gallery and a simple information page about the owner
 • the main gallery page images change dynamically when clicking on different categories on the navigation bar which has 5 categories and each one has its own images
