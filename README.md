## Project Description

This is a personal project created as a showcase for my freelance retouching hobby. The goal was to have a website that presents my works in a personalized manner.

### Features

- Uploaded images using a free image hosting service and utilized private links for referencing them.
- The website consists of two main pages:
  - **Image Gallery**: A horizontal slider gallery that dynamically changes images when clicking on different categories in the navigation bar.
  - **Information Page**: A simple page providing details about the owner.
